## # About `corx`
 `corx` is a simple, efficient programming language designed for systems-level programming with a focus on manual memory management and minimalistic syntax. With `corx`, you have full control over system resources, offering maximum performance and clarity, without the overhead of complex language features. Whether you're developing performance-critical applications or need a low-level language with modern features like contract-based design, `corx` is built to meet those needs.

Explore the [documentation](https://sajibsrs.github.io/corx-lang/) and learn how `corx` can help you write clean, efficient, and performance-driven code.
